--ML PROJECT BASICS

Steps In ML Project:

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor and maintain your system.


Design consideration in problem framing:

* Is this a supervised, unsupervised or a RL problem?
* Is this a classification, regression or some other task?
* What is the nature of the output: single or multiple  outputs?
* Does system need continuous learning or periodic updates?
* What would be the learning style: batch or online?
